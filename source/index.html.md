# Introduction

This is the documentation for MailWizz 2.x API.

For MailWizz 1.x API documentation, please see this [link](/v1).  

In order to integrate MailWizz with 3rd-party apps or any custom apps, you can use its powerful API.

The API is providing the basic operations needed for your implementation. 

This document will drive you through the MailWizz available SDKs .

**Available implementations**:

[The PHP SDK](https://github.com/ems-api/php-client)

**Compatible implementations**:

[The Python SDK](https://github.com/twisted1919/mailwizz-python-sdk).

[The Ruby SDK](https://github.com/twisted1919/mailwizz-ruby-sdk).

[A small rest app that acts as a proxy between MailWizz and any other software](https://github.com/thangtx/mailwizzphpapi-wrap).

[Node.js implementations](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-mailwizz).

**HTTP Methods used**

We follow the REST standards for MailWizz's API interaction, which means that we use following HTTP methods during communication:

* POST - when items are created

* GET - when items are listed

* PUT - when items are updated

* DELETE - when items are deleted

You will have to make sure your server supports all these methods.

If you are doing API calls and get HTTP Forbidden errors, when updating or deleting items, it means your server does not support PUT/DELETE and you must change it's configuration to allow these methods.

**Authorization**

Authentication is done by sending your API key in a custom header called X-Api-Key.

**Data Format**

When sending data to the API endpoints, it is sent in form-data format and returned as json.
